# Hi, I'm Ahmed Atrees.

**Principal Software Engineer | Technical Consultant | System Architect**

I design and guide mission-critical systems that run at national scale. With 20+ years of experience, I specialize in transforming complex business requirements—specifically in **Digital Media, Government, and Enterprise CMS**—into resilient, high-performance software architectures.

> *I don't just write code; I build the pipelines, standards, and teams that ship it.*

### 🏛 Architectural Focus
I focus on the "Day 2" problems of software: **Scalability, Observability, and Maintainability.**

*   **High-Scale Content Platforms:** Architected digital publishing workflows for Egypt's largest press institutions (Al-Ahram, Dar El-Helal).
*   **Enterprise Modernization:** Migrating legacy monolithic ERP/CMS systems to decoupled, service-oriented architectures using **.NET** and **Laravel**.
*   **AI Integration:** Engineering practical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines to assist editorial teams with SEO, translation, and content generation.

### 🛠 The Tech Stack
My toolbox focuses on production stability and developer experience (DX).

| Domain | Technologies & Patterns |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend Core** | .NET Core (C#), Laravel (PHP), Entity Framework, Clean Architecture |
| **Data & Caching** | SQL Server, MySQL, Redis (High-availability caching strategies) |
| **Infrastructure** | CI/CD Pipelines, Docker, IIS/Linux Tuning, CDN Optimization |
| **System Design** | Event-Driven Architecture, Micro-services (where pragmatic), DDD |
| **Leadership** | Agile/Scrum Coaching, Technical Hiring, Team Mentorship |

### 📖 Engineering Philosophy
*   **Pragmatism over Hype:** I choose boring technology for critical infrastructure. Innovation belongs in the product features, not the database layer.
*   **Performance is a Feature:** On national news platforms, milliseconds translate to readership. I prioritize database tuning, aggressive caching, and async job processing.
*   **Developer Enablement:** A Principal Engineer's job is to unblock the team. I invest heavily in CI/CD automation, standardized logging, and documentation.

### 💼 Selected Impact
*   **Al-Ahram Gate & Ahram Online:** Led the technical vision for one of the Middle East's highest-traffic news portals, ensuring uptime during peak national events.
*   **Government Digital Transformation:** Consulted for the National Press Authority to modernize IT infrastructure and workflow systems across multiple press institutions.
*   **Administrative Control Systems:** Designed secure, auditable workflow systems for sensitive government administrative controls.
